            New Mission in <br>Tilst

                After a long search, we have finally found new premises, so we can get started again with what we love
                most: to build cool challenges for you! This time we have allied ourselves with a group of skilled
                theater technicians, to ensure that the quality of both game design, puzzles, decorations and effects
                will be among the best in Denmark.<br><br>
                The address for our new department will be Langk√¶rvej 2B, 8381 Tilst - close to Bilka. In the long run,
                the department will accommodate 5 different escape room experiences, and we have selected themes
                carefully so that there will be something for everyone. See i.a. forward to colorful adventures for the
                whole family, competitive duels between large groups, hardcore challenges for the sharpest brains, and
                disturbing thrills for those who have ice in their stomachs.<br><br>
